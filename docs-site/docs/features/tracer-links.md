## What it is

Tracer Links rewrite outbound resume links to JobOps redirect links for a specific job when you generate a PDF.

Instead of linking directly to your destination URL, the PDF link points to your JobOps instance:

- original: `https://github.com/yourname`
- traced: `https://your-jobops-host/cv/<first>-<company>-xx`

When someone opens the traced link, JobOps records a click event and redirects to the original destination.

## Why it exists

Without tracer links, you cannot measure resume-link engagement.

Tracer links let you answer:

- whether links in your PDF were opened
- which links got opened
- rough human vs bot activity
- per-job link engagement trends

The feature is designed with privacy-safe defaults (no raw IP storage).

## How to use it

1. Open a job in **Jobs**.
2. In tailoring or job details, enable **Tracer links for this job**.
3. Generate or regenerate the PDF.
4. Open **Tracer Links** in navigation to view:
   - global totals
   - top jobs and top links
   - per-job drilldown by Job ID

Important behavior:

- Tracer links are **off by default** per job.
- Toggle changes apply on the **next PDF generation**.
- Existing PDFs are not modified retroactively.

### Required background-run setting

If PDFs are generated by background pipeline runs, set:

```bash
JOBOPS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-jobops-host
```

JobOps uses this URL when request host inference is not available.

## Common problems

### Tracer links enabled but PDF generation fails

Cause:

- `JOBOPS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is missing for a background/pipeline run

Fix:

- set `JOBOPS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your public JobOps URL
- regenerate the PDF

### I enabled tracer links, but old PDF links are still direct

Cause:

- toggle changes only apply to newly generated PDFs

Fix:

- regenerate the PDF for that job

### Analytics look inflated by scanners

Cause:

- email/link scanners and preview bots may open links automatically

Fix:

- use the **Include likely bots** filter in Tracer Links analytics
